# Fight Monsters

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dev Setup

Clone the directory, or better yet fork it.

Inside you can start a dev server and hack away:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## The game


### Concept

This is currently an ultra-simple game designed as an exercise to review React and Redux. Monsters are bad and scary. You are good and powerful. Fight monsters. Make the world better.


### Deployment

Currently deployed with `yarn deploy` which builds the index in root on the deploy branch.
